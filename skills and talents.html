                <P>When we're talking about skills, i think i got really
                    great cooking skills. I'm not always in the kitchen
                    bt when i find the chance I really go all in and give
                    the best. Lets say i also got some coding skills .
                    That's all from the course I'm learning of course bt still 
                    counts.
                    For talents I do have a couple. But the one's really known 
                    are singing and dancing. Both of these i started at a really
                    young age and are the two favourite things i love doing. I give 
                    some credit to my church for my singing talent because that's where 
                    the voice coordination started. I think I've always been a great dancer
                    bt sometimes I tend to get discouraged or just feel I'm not good enough
                    at it. But when i do dance , that's one of the thing that keep me calm.
