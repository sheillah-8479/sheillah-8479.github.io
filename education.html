            <p>I started kindergarten school when I was three years old.
                I started at Unity Primary school located at Umoja then 
                later on gradguated into lower primary still at Unity school.
                I studied at Unity till grade 5 the first two terms and later
                I transferred to Itierio boarding school in the third term.
                I'd say i didn't have the worst boarding school experience 
                because I was related to the headteacher. Though boarding life
                was tough i won't lie bt I survived through till my eighth grade
                and did my KCPE national exams. 
                In high school i got to join The Mary Leakey Girls' High School.
                I did enjoy my highschool life and really got to meet amazing people
                We still talk with some of my high school friends bt some we lost contact.
                My favourite subject in highschool was Chemistry . It always felt nice being
                awarded the best student in chemistry .Of course not all the time
                bt the few times i got to be awarded. highschool had some down sides to it
                bt life was not all hell. I did my KCSE 2021 and i passed with a mean grade
                of B which helped me manage to join a wonderful University. I joined Zetech 
                University 2022 and still pursuing  Degree in Bachelor Of Science in Information Technology.
